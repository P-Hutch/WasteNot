# Interactive Portfolio

This example shows a simple interactive portfolio for a Codecademy graduate in Full Stack, AI Engineering, and Data Analytics.

The site uses [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) to create a small 3D desert scene inspired by Arizona. It includes basic cactus shapes and a placeholder cowboy model. The slider in the top left lets visitors zoom in and out of the scene, giving a playful way to explore the portfolio page.

## Running Locally

Just open `index.html` in a modern web browser. No build step is required.

## Customizing the Scene

- Replace the placeholder GLTF model URL with your own cowboy model.
- Add more 3D objects such as rocks, additional cacti, or even mountains by inserting more A-Frame primitives or GLTF models.
- Edit the HTML to showcase your projects and achievements within the 3D space.

Feel free to extend this with additional interactivity using JavaScript or A-Frame components.
